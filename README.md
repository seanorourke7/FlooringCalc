# Flooring Measuring Tool

This is a measuring tool designed to help clients easily determine how many boxes of flooring they will need for a job and how much it will cost. 

I built it to demonstrate my abilities in Python and as a tool I can use in the real world. 

The tool takes several inputs from the user and calculates the size of the area being worked and how many boxes will be needed to cover said area. It also calculates any discount that may be currently available. In this instance it will be either 3 for 2 or 4 for 3.

## How To Use

The first input asked is the measurment type being used. Feet or Meters. 

Once the measurement is determined the user is then asked for the length and width of the space to be covered. 

The next input determines the coverage in each box. This allows for the varied options of flooring as different styles will have a different square meter coverage per box.
